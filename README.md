## Quickstart

You can configure and build MotionBox with a single line:

    sh build.sh <win32 | win64 | macOS | linux | android> all

For instance you would do that for Windows 64 bit:

    * open Git Bash *
    git clone https://github.com/omega-gg/MotionBox.git
    cd MotionBox
    sh build.sh win64 all

That's a convenient way to configure and build everything the first time.

Note: This will create the 3rdparty and Sky folder in the parent directory.

## Building

Alternatively, you can run each step of the build yourself by calling the following scripts:

Install the dependencies:

    sh 3rdparty.sh <win32 | win64 | macOS | linux | android> [all]

Configure the build:

    sh configure.sh <win32 | win64 | macOS | linux | android> [sky | clean]

Build the application:

    sh build.sh <win32 | win64 | macOS | linux | android> [all | deploy | clean]

Deploy the application and its dependencies:

    sh deploy.sh <win32 | win64 | macOS | linux | android> [clean]
